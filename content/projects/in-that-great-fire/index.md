{{% overview-text %}}

A silent roleplaying game in which players collectively describe a city on index cards, before racing to complete their goals as the flames engulf their writing. The proceedings are dictated by a receipt printer.

The game was playtested once, and has since never been repeated. I would like to change this.

After writing their own descriptions of the city on index cards, the players each select a stationery item. The items assign them a role, whose burden they must complete as the city burns around them:

- An **artist**, who uses the _scalpel_ to cut phrases from the players' writing, and composes them into a poem
- A **seeker**, who races to recover artifacts illustrated by the players into an _envelope_ before they are destroyed by the fire
- A **statistician**, who must measure and record onto their _clipboard_ increasingly many lexical statistics about the city
- A **killer**, who hunts the other players and drips _red ink_ footsteps onto the index cards
- And **The Great Fire** itself, who rips up artifacts and with a _black marker pen_ destroys the descriptions of the city
