Twelve strangers are leaving Earth in a hurry. If they're to reach their destination planet and not be left stranded in space, they must become close enough to work together, be it through friendship, sex, or romance. *Kiss Space* is a narrative simulation, in which we hear the randomly generated story from the perspective of one of the twelve randomly generated crewmates.
