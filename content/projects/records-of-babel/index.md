Why build a tower to the gods? How could you fail so gracelessly? Where did the guns come from?

_Records of Babel_ is a fragmentary narrative of a future that never lived. I hate you, but I will not let them forget you.

Across ~five~ four acts, the tale of a tower constructed, lived in, and ultimately abandoned is told from several entirely different perspectives. An old man recounts the lives of the two Bastard Sisters who led the Babylonian people, while an impartial timeline warns of the swelling imperial forces outside the tower. A future explorer writes letters to his wife as he ascends the abandoned tower. The gods watch on from above.

The four acts are laser-engraved into wood panels, layering 3D renderings and experimental writing. A fifth act is hidden away, describing in pure prose the sin that broke the tower's people.

_Records of Babel_ has so far been exhibited in two community gardens: Everton Community Garden as part of the show _Ground Works_, and Royal Holloway Community Garden as a solo exhibition.
