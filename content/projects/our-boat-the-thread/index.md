The protagonist's lover, a childhood friend who became empress, is dead. With her, the underworld she shaped in her own image is crumbling. You play as the Fates, steering the protagonist in her old motorboat where she must go.

Depending on the path taken, the game concludes in one of three wildly divergent endings. Together, they tell a story of cultural death, rebirth, and betrayal. Not all is as it seems.

The game was produced in collaboration with [Alex Brettell](https://www.instagram.com/folkvutur/). He produced the wooden tiller controller and the incredible soundscape.

The game has been installed at Limits and Demonstrations, [Shuffle](https://shuffleshuffleshuffle.co.uk/), and most recently [the 2024 Degree Show at LJMU](https://lsad.co.uk/students/ada-null/).

*our boat, the Thread* was written about by Gabrielle de la Puente for The White Pube. From the article:

*"The boat chugged over lakes, through a half-sunken church, into dark sewers and glowing caves. At one point, the player had to keep the boat straight across a tense waterfall bridge that stretched across blank space with no boundaries. We arrived into a starry globe where a translucent ghost standing next to a bonfire was waiting on the shores to meet us. I got completely pulled into the whole thing. I couldnâ€™t really believe that this was in a BA degree show."*
