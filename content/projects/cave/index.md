A multiplayer Choose Your Own Adventure game dealt in cards by a veiled figure. Explore the cave with your fellow strangers to find the tomb of your House, or do something completely different.

There are several moments in the game that allow you to directly interact with your fellow players, such as rolling back a rock together or making a certain path inaccessible to others. Most of the time, however, you must remain silent, except for speaking aloud echoes of your current location.
